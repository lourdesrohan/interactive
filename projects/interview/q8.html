                  I feel like art is very Intrinsic to who I am.<br /><br />for as long as I can remember, I’ve been a
                  super creative person. Um, My mom has like drawings and paintings from when I was like two or three,
                  like that she&#39;s kept. And I really can&#39;t remember a time where I wasn&#39;t doing art in some
                  way. <br /><br />when I was young, um, I was obsessed with Play-Doh like, Play-Doh is my big thing.<br /><br />It
                  made me really happy. But instead of just like, you know, messing around with Play-Doh. I’d make
                  Gourmet breakfast meals. I would like mold the colors and like very carefully layer them on top of
                  each other. <br /><br />I think art has always just been something to do. <br /><br />and recently
                  it&#39;s been kind of hard to engage with it, especially after coming to Yale because Yale makes it
                  feel like there is a right and wrong way to art, Which is really frustrating.</span

                  eah, that&#39;s very fair. like, retweet with the “art here is frustrating.” Like, it really is.<br /><br />it&#39;s
                  intimidating. So like, you know, even just like the word, like art, or&nbsp;&nbsp;telling yourself “I
                  am an artist,” you know, like it feels as if there are qualifications that you have to meet To be an
                  artist. <br /><br />like, no, like art is like this beautiful thing that we can all do. Let&#39;s not

                particular way.
