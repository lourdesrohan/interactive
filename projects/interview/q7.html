                    Okay. I have to get it to show you because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to make sense otherwise.
                    <br /><br />This is like my favorite because it’s literally just for me, like, it doesn&#39;t
                    matter. It&#39;s very insignificant, but it makes me very happy. <br /><br />Um, so I keep an art
                    journal. <br /><br />This is my favorite, because it&#39;s just like, ah, this is fun. I can just
                    like sit and do it and There&#39;s no like right or wrong way to do this. And I wouldn&#39;t say
                    that I am not creative, but I have very. Like very rarely do I come up with original ideas on my
                    own.</span

                    created yourself, because I feel like I&#39;m taking a lot of art classes semester and people
                    instinctively are like, Well, “i love rembrandt,” and all these old artists... like okay.<br /><br />it&#39;s
